# SDMFinalProject
This project deals with design of Artificial Dielectric Slab(s) using spectral domain methods

Problem statement in brief:

An interface between air and a material with permittivity of 20 is given. 
The Spectral Domain transmission line mode has to be found.
Real and artificial dielectric slab has to be designed to maximize the power transfer between two medium for normal incidence.
Multi-section transformers has to be implemented to increase the bandwith of the single section transformers designed previously.
Articial dielectric multi-section transforms has to be designed.

Effective impedance technique was used to design the ADL slabs.
Binomial multi-section transformers were designed.

Terahertz sensing group's (TU Delft) ADL tool was used for verifying the results of single section ADL layers.

Implementation of S parameters to permittivity and permeability is the task that needs to be done for further improving the results.
